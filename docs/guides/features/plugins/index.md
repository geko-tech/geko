# Plugins

Plugins allow you to extend Geko's functionality and adapt it to the specific needs of your project. Geko offers a wide range of options for modifying, generating, and connecting custom plugins.

We provide four types of plugins: 
* ProjectDescriptionHelpers – allows you to simplify and automate the description of modules, as well as influence the generation of the project by processing ENV flags.
* Template – allows you to reuse templates between projects
* WorkspaceMapper – allows access to the project graph loading stage during the generation phase.
* Executable – allows you to include any executable files via a link and use them when working with your project
